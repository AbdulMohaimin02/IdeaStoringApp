# Idea Spark (Idea storing app)


## Description 

This app is designed around the concept of quickly storing your ideas. I got the idea for this app when I realised that all my ideas for different projects and activities were scattered across half a dozen note taking apps and note books. I realised that having a dedicated place to store all your ideas would be extreamly convinent, therefor I made Idea Spark.

My aim for this app was to provide a really nice UI experieance for the user and make the process of storing and viewing your ideas very simple. I also added a section on the home screen to store your favourite ideas. That way you can have your best ideas front and center.
