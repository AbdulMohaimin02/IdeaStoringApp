# Idea Spark (Idea storing app)


## Description 

This app is designed around the concept of quickly storing your ideas. This allows the user to have one convenient place to store all their ideas.

My aim for this app was to provide a clean and aesthetic UI and make the process of storing and viewing your ideas very simple. I also added a section on the home screen to store your favourite ideas, so the user can easily access their best ideas.

This app is an original personal project.

## Technologies 

- Jetpack compose for next generation of UI design
- Other Jetpack Libraries for backend functionality such as navigation and ViewModels 
- Room Database for all CRUD functionality
- Kotlin Coroutines for handling database requests on a separate thread
- MVVM desing structure 
- SOLID principles 

## How to use 

Using this app is simple and intuitive. The processes for adding, updating, viewing and deleting ideas are all shown in the gifs below.
